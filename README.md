- 👋🏽 - I am currently a computer science student at the University of the People.  I am expecting to graduate with my Associate of Science in 2024 and go on to earn industry certifications. I am currently documenting my technical journey, which will outline my industry experience in Python and web development. I previously completed a web development course at CodePath, and I am open to exploring and gaining more knowledge on web development!

- 🎯 - My prospect is to start off by going into technical support while focusing on Python automation and integration and leveraging this skill for my cybersecurity path.

- 💭 - I intend to focus on Ethical Hacking; Cybersecurity, and Web Development. Thank you for coming to my profile.
