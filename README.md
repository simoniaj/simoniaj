- 👋🏽 - I am currently a computer science student at University of the People.  I am expecting to graduate with my Associates of Science in 2024 and go on to earn industry certifications. I am open to opportunities that will allow me to gain industry experience in coding languages such as Python, and Java. I previously completed a Web Development course at CodePath and I am open to exploring and gaining more knowledge on web development!

- 💭 - I intend to focus on Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity and Web Development. Thank you for coming to my profile.
