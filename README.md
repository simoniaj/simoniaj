- 👋🏽 - I am currently a computer science student at the University of the People.  I am expecting to graduate with my Associate of Science in 2024 and go on to earn industry certifications. I am currently documenting my technical journey which will outline my industry experience in coding languages such as Python, Java, and Web Development. I previously completed a Web Development course at CodePath and I am open to exploring and gaining more knowledge on web development!

- 💭 - I intend to focus on Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity, and Web Development. Thank you for coming to my profile.
